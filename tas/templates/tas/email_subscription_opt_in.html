    <h3>Dear {{user.first_name}},</h3>
    
    <p>Welcome to Chameleon – we’re excited to have you join us!</p>

    <p>Before you start experimenting there are a few important things we ask you to do:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://lists.chameleoncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/outages" target="_blank">Sign up to the outages@chameleoncloud.org mailing list</a>: this is the best way to find out about Chameleon outages – if you don’t keep track of this information you risk having them impact your experiments.
            An alternative way of finding out about outages is to look at the <a href="https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/outages/" target="_blank">outages tab in your dashboard</a> – however, with email notifications you don’t need to keep checking the website.</li>
    
        <li><a href="https://lists.chameleoncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/users" target="_blank">
            Sign up to the users@chameleoncloud.org mailing list</a>: this is where all user discussions (including users helping users) take place and is the best place to find out any news about the system.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    We’d also like to draw your attention to the user icon in the top right corner of <a href="https://www.chameleoncloud.org" target="_blank">www.chameleoncloud.org</a>: once you’re added to a Chameleon project, it provides a shortcut to the Chameleon GUI via the <a href="https://www.chameleoncloud.org/docs/getting-started/experiment-quickstart/" target="_blank">experiment option</a>.
    
    If at any point you need help please submit a ticket via the <a href="https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/help/ticket/new" target="_blank">help desk</a>.
    
    And now the fun begins: click on our <a href="https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">getting started guide</a> and give it a whirl!
    </p>
    <p>
    Happy experimenting, we are looking forward to working with you!
